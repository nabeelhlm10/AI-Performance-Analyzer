venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env  # or manually create it

# Add the following to .env:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FLASK_ENV=development
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
